# 9CT Assessment task 1
### By Vanessa He

## Requirements Outline
 Write 2-3 sentences  explaining what your robot is designed to do in this challenge:

I need to design a program for the EV3 mindstorms robot where it navigates and picks up red and yellow blocks using the color sensor and bring them back to the starting zone while detecting and avoiding obstacles.

Identify key actions:
List at least 3-5 specific actions your robot needs to complete the task.

1. pick up the red and yellow blocks
2. detect the colours of the blocks and obstacles
3. if the obstacle detected is green or blue, it turns 90° degrees away and continues navigating
4. navigate and bring the red and yellow blocks back to the starting zone

### Functional Requirements
For each key action, write a functional requirement that clearly states what the robot must do. These should be written in a clear and concise manner.

- the robot must be able to spear and hook the red and yellow blocks onto itself

-  obstacle detection: the robot must stop and turn 90°  when the ultrasonic sensor detects an object within 10 cm
